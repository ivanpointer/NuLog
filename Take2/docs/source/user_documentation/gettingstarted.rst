If you are totally new to logging in software, first read :ref:`introtologging`.

If you are new to tag-based logging, read :ref:`intrototaglogging`.

Step 1: Install Using NuGet
===========================

NuLog is delivered using NuGet.  Look for, and install the NuLog package into any project you wish to use NuLog for.  NuLog supports .Net versions 3.5, 4 and 4.5.2 (and on).

You'll want to get your configuration squared away.  For more information on configuring NuLog, head over to :ref:`configtemplate`.

`Log` vs. `LogNow`
------------------
NuLog is designed to defer the actual action of dispatching and logging a log event to a queue that is managed by a background process (thread).  This allows control to return to the logging method much sooner, instead of having to wait for the log message to be dispatched before returning.  When calling :code:`Log` on the `Logger`, the log event is generated by the `Logger`, then added to a queue for dispatch by a background process.  To dispatch a log event for immediate logging, use :code:`LogNow` instead.
